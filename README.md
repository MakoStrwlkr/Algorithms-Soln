# Algorithms-Soln
My solutions to exercises in Algorithms by Dasgupta, Papadimitriou, Vazirani

This is still very much a Work-in-Progress. So far, I have covered the Prologue, and parts of Chapter 1 (which I haven't yet included because it lacks proofreading).

I estimate this will be covered by the time the Winter 2021 semester ends (around April).
